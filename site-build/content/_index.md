### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

Welcome to our pages on the command line interface! These can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshops.

Understanding the command line is an important foundation for many computational skills. Learning to program, how to use high-performance computers, and how to share your code with collaborators all require at least some knowledge of the command line. In this session, we will guide you through using the command line, build your confidence, and understand what we are doing, step by step!

This session covers the "UNIX-like" (sometimes "\*nix") command line. This is used by Linux, MacOS, most servers, as well as all HPC and computing clusters. Window's default command line is run by "Powershell", which we do not cover in this course. Windows can emulate a UNIX-like terminal, so please continue to learn more.
