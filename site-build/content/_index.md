### University of Bristol âˆ™ Research Computing Training

*Welcome to this introduction to the command line interface! These pages can be followed in your own time, but also guide our training workshops.*

Understanding the command line is an important foundation for many computational skills. Learning to code, using high-performance computers, and research collaboration all rely on a knowledge of the command line. We welcome all levels of learners, and this course is designed for total beginners. We will build your confidence, explain the confusing computing vocabulary, and help you to understand what we are doing, step by step!

{{< admonition type="warning" title="Info: the UNIX command line" open=false >}}
This session covers the "UNIX-like" (sometimes "\*nix") command line. This is used by Linux, MacOS, most servers, as well as all HPC and computing clusters. Window's default command line is run by "Powershell", which we do not cover in this course. Windows can emulate a UNIX-like terminal, so please continue to learn more.
