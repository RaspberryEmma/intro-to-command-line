### Pipes

The pipe operator, looks like this `|` (to the left of the enter key on MacOS, and to the left of the number row on Windows). A pipe allows us to take the output of one command, and use it as the input for another command. For example, we can count the number of lines of each file in our folder of Shakespeare plays, using `wc`. But what if we wanted these in order, numerically? This is where we could use a *pipe*. A series of pipe and command operations is known as a "pipeline" (these might be saved as a small program, or a "script").

We can use the output of `wc` as the input for `sort`. Try these commands in the folder `some_plays`

```
wc -l * | sort
```

Here the *output* of the command `wc -l *` is being *piped* into the command `sort`. Building up commands with pipes can lead to some very powerful automation.

Use pipes to answer these questions:
- How many `.txt` files are in the `some_plays` folder? (hint: use `ls` and `grep`)
- Which play has exactly 5730 lines? (hint: use `grep` and `wc`)
- How many lines, in all the plays, have *both* the words "true" and "love" in?
- What is the total line count of every file in the folder? (A single number)
- What is the 629th line of *Pericles*? (use `head` and `tail`)
- What is the 97th line of *Othello*, backwards?
- What is the 107th from last line of *Antony and Cleopatra*?
- What are the five longest plays, in order of line count? (Don't include the total from `sort`)

### Using pipes and redirects together

Combining redirects and pipes can be very powerful. Here is a simple example where we pipe one command to another, then send the output of the next command into a file:

```
wc -l * | sort -r > ordered_by_line
```

Understanding this kind of flow is essentially the first step towards programming. While the command line is a whole scripting language in itself, as things get more sophisticated we start to use proper programming languages. This aids in compatibility, portability, and allows you to use purpose-built tools.

{{< admonition type="question" title="Exercise" open=true >}}
- Count the total number of lines with the word "bird" in all the plays.
- Make a new file containing every line in these plays with the word "hills" in.
- Pipe `wc` into `sort` into `head` to get the three shortest plays in our folder of plays.
