### Managing sequence data on the command line

This section is aimed at those wanting to use the command line, and perhaps computing clusters, to work with sequence information (that is, genetic, genomic, proteomic and other bioinformatic data). We recommend using a dedicated programming language for more complex work: this is easier to share, replicate, test and collaborate on. But the command line remains a useful environment to acquire and manage data, especially as the first part of an analysis pipeline.

Here we are going to use the command line to download some sequence information from a major genomic information repository, called NCBI. We will be asking the repo for a particular gene sequence from a range of organisms, and then cleaning the data ready for downstream work.

- If you didn't look up `echo` earlier, use `man` to work out what it does.
- Think of `echo` as `print`, used commonly in programming languages.

### Exercise
Let's work with some real data to answer some real research questions! Firstly, we are going to acquire a genome to work with. Go to [NCBI genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and in the search dropdown menu, select `Genome`. While you are here, notice the other databases that NCBI hosts. Lots of these are quite niche, but common ones to use are `Genome`, `Gene`, `Protein` and `SRA`, the latter for raw, unassembled sequence reads.

With `Genome` as your search database, type "covid", and run the search. You should get one result (if you get more, choose the top result). Note the information get here, with XXXXXXX

{{< admonition type="question" title="Exercise" open=true >}}
- How long is this genome, in kilobases? 
- What is the total nucleotide count each for A, T, C and G in this genome?
- How many times do we see the start codon (Methionine) in the genome?
- How many times does the motif ATGTAG occur in the genome?
- Assume that all protein-coding genes in this genome start with the motifs ATGCTT and ATGACC. How many genes does this covid-19 genome appear to contain?
- What limitations does this approach have?

If you can complete this task - congratulations, you now know all of the important ways of navigating the file system, of searching files, and the basics of shell scripting.

{{< admonition type="success" title="Learn more" open=true >}}
When learning to use computer clusters and high-performance computers, we often run jobs using "submission scripts". These are just the same as a shell script - they are not magic, merely running commands one after another, just like you could on the command line itself.

You can learn these skills in our course *Introduction to HPC*, do an internet search for our current courses.
