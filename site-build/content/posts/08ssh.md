### Working remotely

The original super-power of the command line is that it allows us to connect to other machines. While we now have remote-desktops and screen-shares to see and work with other computers's GUIs, the command line has been doing this since the 1960s! In research, we often work on remote machines ("computing clusters", "supercomputers", "HPC", or even just "servers"), which we need to log in to. Once we are logged in, the terminal will behave as if we are sitting at that machine, which might be on the other side of the world. (As such, it can be confusing to know whether a terminal is just controlling your computer, or a different computers, as the terminal will still look very similar!)

### Logging into a computer using `ssh`

`ssh` is a program for opening a command line session on a remote computer. The name is short for "secure shell", because it opens a shell to communicate with the remote machine, using an encrypted, secure connection. In other words, it uses the internet to talk to another computer, and that conversation is private, locked with encryption keys. (This happens for almost all communications on your computer and phone, for example.)

We have specific documentation for how to use `ssh` (and `scp`) on our [HPC training](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/protected/hpc-docs/training/intro-to-hpc-slurm/logging_on.html). Here we will cover the basics of how to understand these commands, and their syntax.

Note that University of Bristol machines will only allow you access when your connection is using the university's VPN service. See [these pages](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/vpn.aspx) for more details on how to install the VPN on your computer.

### Using the command line, but on a remote machine

Using `ssh` from the command line will require a valid log in or user account on the machine you want to log in to. The syntax is to run `ssh` followed by your username and the hostname (just like in a prompt), for example
```shell
ssh yt29876@bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk
```
or, you might log in using the IP address of the remote machine
```shell
ssh yt29876@137.222.1.10
```
You will then be asked to enter your password - it will not display anything or display stars (\*) as you type, it will just look empty. If the password is correct, you will then see a new prompt, including the name of the machine you are now logged in to:
```
[yt29876@bc4login3 ~]$
```
{{< admonition type="tip" title="Useful tip!" open=true >}}
If you forget your `ssh` logins, remember that all your commands are stored in `history`. Perfect use of a pipe! To get your previous `ssh` commands, we can pipe the output of `history` into `grep`, searching for `ssh`, with
`history | grep ssh`

Now your command line session is running *another* command line session, on another computer. (Like in *Inception*. I expect that cultural reference is out of date now.) Just like with a local command line, you can leave using the command `exit`. You will be able to move around and run commands, just like on the machine that is actually in front of you. Obviously, other machines will be structured differently, and have security measures meaning you cannot look at other people's folders or run dangerous commands. If you are using shared computing facilities, as with all of the University of Bristol's computing clusters, keep in mind that you are in a bustling hub of colleagues and researchers - you can see who is logged on with the command `w` (yes, just a "w").

For HPC machines *make sure you do not run research work on the login nodes!* An HPC machine has a "headnode", a kind of "lobby" where you can arrange your work, and you send your analysis in to the proper factory-floor of powerful computers using submission scripts. Running "on the headnode" is like walking into an industrial facility, then asking the receptionist to do the industrial work! Not only is this slow, but it can break the whole system, which could result in the loss of work of many of researchers! Avoid this at all costs :)

We do not cover job scheduling in this course, but to learn more please see our [HPC resources](https://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/protected/hpc-docs/introduction/index.html)

### Copying files to and from remote machines using `scp`

`scp` ("secure copy") is just like `cp`, except it can copy files and folders to and from another computer. Just like with `ssh` above, we will need to specify what computer the file or folder is on, and so `scp` uses syntax just like in a prompt to designate a location. First, let's copy a file *from* our local machine to another machine. If you have the resources from earlier in this course, try copying one of the plays to another machine. As with `cp`, the syntax is `cp [what to copy] [where to copy this to]`. Move to the appropriate folder, and try a command similar to this (you will need to substitute a real username and hostname!)
```shell
scp macbeth.txt yt29876@bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk:/user/home/yt29876
```
Note that the destination includes a full path. Sometimes, the remote machine will understand `~` as your home folder, and missing it out completely will also work, sending the file to your home folder. The important bit is, don't forget the `:`, or your computer will think you want to copy the file locally, and name the file the name of the remote computer! So, if you see a file hanging around called, for example `yt29876@bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk`, this is usually the result of a failed `scp`.

{{< admonition type="Warning" open=true >}}
Careless use of `scp` can result in data loss! If a file with the same name already exists in the remote machine, it will be permanently overwritten, without warning, by `scp`!
{{< /admonition >}}

Copying from the remote machine back to your local machine uses similar syntax, except you must provide the full path to the path you want to copy (and you can specify the local location with just a `.` (or any location you like)). So, the above command in reverse would be
```shell
scp yt29876@bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk:/user/home/yt29876/macbeth.txt .
```
{{< admonition type="Info" open=true >}}
Sending information back to your local machine while using `ssh` to work on another machine is not possible. The internet just doesn't work that way! A valid remote machine is "known" to the internet (can be looked up), has a public IP address, and has its communication channels set to be able to communicate both ways. In contrast, your own private machine, typically, is not open for other computers to directly connect to it - so trying to `scp` back to your own machine won't work, as the internet has no idea what or where your own computer is!
