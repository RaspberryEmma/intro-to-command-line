# intro-to-command-line

Welcome!

This repository holds the source markdown files, and resulting HTML files for the course [_Introduction to the Command Line_](https://altanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/), as delivered by the Research Software Engineering team at the University of Bristol.

The editable markdown files are in `intro-to-command-line/site-build/content` and `intro-to-command-line/site-build/content/posts`. Any pushes to `master` will trigger the Github Action `.github/workflow/push-deploy.yml` (Hugo build and deploy site - takes a couple of minutes, cache refresh might be needed to see changes).

The file and folder structure here relates to assets created by Hugo (the style template), as run in the GitHub actions workflow.
